What is the problem?
When I run any of my scripts to run my server, whether through nodemon or through webpack-dev-server, I get an error that I have exceeded the limit for file watchers

What did I expect?
I expected to be able to run my scripts like I have been for most of the day. I had this earlier in the day and restarting VScode fixed it.

What have I tried?
I've restarted VSCode, restarted my computer, checked if the ports I'm using still have servers running on them, and googled the problem.

Why I suspect it's not working:
Somehow, there is still something running in the background and my server is tryig to run on top of that.
